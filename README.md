<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged FAP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new FAPs. Note that an FAP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your FAP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

TLDR: hire Rachel as Project Manager 
*(her Action Plan for what she plans to *do* as PM will be a separate vote)

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the FAP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the FAP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Elect rachelg.eth / @bruleeshark / @rachelgdoteth to be femboyDAO Project Manager and serve as a general overseer of business activities, including but not limited to primary authorship of new proposals, community moderation, femboyDAO team management and recruiting, etc.

## Background
Last November, a [governance proposal was passed](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/femboy-dao/proposal/65052743183220648491770929723137116040374021417102756972338666238749249176937) to hire Scuffie as project manager for FemboyDAO. That proposal authorized the council to pay Scuffie for his role and to make 15 ETH available to him as an initial project development budget. As scuffie left shortly afterwards, the council still has the ETH transferred to it by the DAO. The council's gnosis safe currently has 16.5 ETH and 8,135 USDC.

This proposal would authorize the council to instead use these funds to pay Rachel's salary and to provide her with a project development budget.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the FAP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the FAP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the FAP will address the issue!-->

femboyDAO is a beloved niche eth/web3 x LGBTQ community DAO and in 2022 it raised 69~ ETH from members and issued 78~ $FEM tokens for governance purposes. Since then, there have occured many tumultuos events in the crypto industry and the intersection of the world's tech savvy and queer communities need a safe, secure "port d'attache" more than ever before.

rachelg.eth (she/her) has been a committed community member of femboyDAO since August 2022, and she has expressed a desire for this role and its responsibilities, as well as a willingness to submit to the rule of the council and final decisionmaking of the $FEM votership in all matters femboyDAO.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the FAP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

 * already implemented pre-proposal
 ^ to be implemented post-proposal

- grant rachel access to femboyDAO github*
- grant rachel access to femboyDAO discord mod powers*
- grant rachel access to femboys.io website^
- grant rachel access to femboydao twitter account*
- grant rachel permission to community moderate discord*
- grant rachel permission to manage/delegate to other femboydao contributors^
- grant rachel permission to plan budgets including but not limited to; advertising, promotion^
- grant rachel permission to solicit for partnerships & collaborations with other web3 projects on behalf of femboyDAO, (decisions subject to governance approval).^

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Discussions in various messaging channels in the community discord lead to a council meeting on April 19th where council members 0xfem, unitylchaos, purposeunknown, and jtriley met with rachelg.eth and interviewed her for the position. Consensus among the council members at this time was to hire rachelg.eth for the position and the absent council members have all individually expressed approval for this informal proposal since the April 19th meeting took place. Rachel has been serving as the "de facto" Project Manager since April 19th, as a result.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public Action Plan of the changes proposed.

- Approval for 10 additional flex hours per week, if necessary for project completion/crunch.
$30/hour - paid in ETH* to this address -> 0x5A094939b4a2110DCF5F0159e0b303732Bd553dD
